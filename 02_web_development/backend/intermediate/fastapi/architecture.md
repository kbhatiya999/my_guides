## Quick Reference
- **Technology**: FastAPI, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal Architecture
- **Use Case**: Building maintainable and scalable FastAPI applications
- **Complexity**: Advanced - requires architecture and design knowledge
- **Prerequisites**: Understanding of FastAPI, software architecture principles, and design patterns

# Clean/Hexagonal Architecture

## Overview

FastAPI applications can benefit greatly from implementing Clean Architecture principles, particularly the Hexagonal Architecture pattern.

## Hexagonal Architecture

Hexagonal Architecture is an implementation of Clean Architecture principles that provides:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between different layers
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- **Testability**: Easy to test individual components in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Clear structure makes code easier to maintain and modify

### Key Benefits

1. **Testability**: Business logic can be tested without external dependencies
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations (e.g., different databases)
3. **Maintainability**: Clear structure makes code easier to understand
4. **Scalability**: Architecture supports growth and complexity
