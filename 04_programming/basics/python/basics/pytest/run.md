# Running Pytest

1. ```bash
     pytest test-file1.py test-file2.py --maxfail=3 --disable-warnings -q
     ```
   - `test-file1.py test-file2.py`: run only these files
   - `--maxfail=3`: stop after 3 failures
   - `--disable-warnings`: hide warning messages
   - `-q`: Runs Pytest in "quiet" mode, minimizing the output to only show essential information like test passes and failures.

2. (Add more commands here as needed)
